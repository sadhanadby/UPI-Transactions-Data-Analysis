#Power BI UX: Bookmarks, Navigators & Multi-Page Sync
This Power BI project helped me understand how to use bookmarks and bookmark navigators to create interactive reports. I learned how to manage multiple bookmarks, sync them across different pages, and control visual visibility effectively. It also gave me hands-on experience in organizing layered elements and troubleshooting UI behavior for a smoother user experience.
